This program was my final project for AP Computer Science 2017.

Given ideal lighting, "Paint" will track the user's hand and allow them
to draw on the screen. The primary focus of this project was to learn
OpenCV.

-- Controls --
Fist (no fingers up): Move your hand around the drawable area.
1 Finger Up: The program will track your fingertip and draw.
2 Fingers Up: The program will let you select which color you want to draw with (not implemented)
